# Experience and Role Based Voting

## Overview

In our DAO, the voting power is primarily based on the experience of your avatar. This document outlines the key principles and mechanics of our voting system.

### Experience-Based Voting Power

- **General Rule**: The higher your experience, the more voting power you have.
  
  **Example**: 
  - An avatar with 1000 XP might have 10 voting points.
  - An avatar with 500 XP might have 5 voting points.

### One Member, One Vote Decisions

- **Special Cases**: For certain community decisions, each member gets one vote, regardless of their XP.
  
  **Example**: 
  - A decision on a new community project might follow the one member, one vote rule.

### Experience Threshold for Voting

- **Threshold Setting**: It's possible to set an XP threshold for voting eligibility on specific matters.
  
  **Example**: 
  - Only members with at least 300 XP can vote on advanced technical proposals.

## Role-Specific Voting

- **Role-Based Restrictions**: Certain decisions, like those regarding code, can only be voted on by members with the coding role.
  
  **Example**:
  - A proposal for a new software feature can be voted on only by members identified as coders.

## Voting Delegation

- **Following Votes**: Members who prefer not to vote or are unsure can choose to follow the vote of another member.
  
  **Example**:
  - If Alice chooses to follow Bob's voting decisions, whenever Bob votes, it's as if Alice has cast the same vote.

## Incentives for Voting

- **Earning Experience by Voting**: Members earn experience points by participating in votes.
- **Reduced XP for Following**: If a member follows someone else's vote, they earn less or no experience points.
  
  **Example**:
  - Voting directly on a proposal might grant 10 XP.
  - Following another member's vote might grant only 5 XP or none, depending on the decision's importance.
